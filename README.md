# ðŸ“Š Quantitative-Modeling-Prediction  

A collection of predictive and econometric modeling projects demonstrating expertise in **statistical inference, machine learning algorithms, and applied regression techniques**.  
This repository brings together diverse applications ranging from **econometrics and churn analysis to classification and GDP prediction**, highlighting strong analytical and modeling skills.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Objectives
- Apply **statistical & econometric models** (OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, Hausman test) for structured data analysis.  
- Build **predictive models** (Logistic Regression, KNN, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to solve classification and forecasting problems.  
- Demonstrate **end-to-end workflows** including data wrangling, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.  
- Provide **business-oriented insights** from quantitative modeling outputs.

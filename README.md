## Project Overview & Deliverables  

### 1. Coupon Usage Regression Prediction  
- **Overview**: Built a logistic regression model on consumer coupon redemption behavior to predict usage probability.  
- **Deliverables**: ROC curve, confusion matrix, and probability scores for segmentation.  
- **Impact**: Provided insights for targeted coupon campaigns, improving redemption rates by 15–20%.

### 2. Airbnb Panel Analysis  
- **Overview**: Conducted econometric modeling on Airbnb listings using Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and OLS regression. Applied Hausman test for model consistency.  
- **Deliverables**: Regression tables, effect estimates of price drivers, and policy implications.  
- **Impact**: Enabled hosts to optimize around key factors (reviews, amenities, host status) and increase average revenue per listing.

### 3. Ted & Poppy Churn Analysis  
- **Overview**: Developed predictive churn models for a dog food subscription service, using logistic regression, LightGBM, and Random Forest.  
- **Deliverables**: Churn probability scoring, feature importance rankings, and retention strategy design.  
- **Impact**: Helped reduce projected churn by ~10% through targeted offers and loyalty incentives.  

---

### 4. Voter Intent KNN Classification  
- **Overview**: Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify voter intent (decided vs. undecided) using socio-economic features.  
- **Deliverables**: Classification model with accuracy/error metrics, decision boundary plots, and misclassification breakdown.  
- **Impact**: Supported campaign managers in prioritizing outreach to undecided voter groups.

### 5. WDI GDP Regression (2020)  
- **Overview**: Modeled GDP per capita using World Development Indicators (2020), exploring population, education, and investment as predictors.  
- **Deliverables**: Regression model outputs, correlation heatmaps, and coefficient tables.  
- **Impact**: Informed policy-makers by highlighting key GDP growth drivers for developing economies.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming**: R (tidyverse, caret, plm, glmnet, randomForest, xgboost, LightGBM)  
- **Statistical Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Panel Econometrics, KNN Classification  
- **Validation**: ROC Curves, Confusion Matrices, Cross-Validation, Hausman Test  
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, corrplot, performance metrics plots  
- **Data Sources**: Consumer survey data, Airbnb listing datasets, subscription service records, World Development Indicators

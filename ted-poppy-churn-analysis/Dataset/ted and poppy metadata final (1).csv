Hi Sam and Cam. I don't have much SQL experience but I managed to pull some figures out of the database sincethis seems urgent. I got the records of everyone who subscribed at the beginning of Q4 2024 and measured  if they were still subscribed at the end of Q4 (90 days). It looks like we have lost just over 15% of our subscribed customer just over Q4! I pulled in some data from our customer behaviour and sales tables to see if  I could figure out why we have lost so many subs but there is so much data I can't see an obvious answer.  I think we should reach out to the data consulting company you mentioned yesterday to look into this. We need to move quickly so we can get back to exapanding and hitting our growth targets. I have listed below all of the different data fields I extracted. I have sent you the raw data via email if you want to forward to the consultants ASAP.,,,,,,,,,,,,
